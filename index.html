    <h3>Projects</h3>
    <h4>Classification of online toxic comments (Using Machine Learning)</h4>
    <p>Classification of online toxic comments using machine learning involves developing algorithms that can automatically detect and categorize harmful or abusive language in online platforms. This process typically includes data collection and preprocessing to handle the variability and noise in user-generated content, followed by feature extraction techniques to capture the semantic meaning of text. Machine learning models, ranging from traditional methods like logistic regression to advanced techniques like deep learning, are trained on labeled datasets to classify comments as toxic or non-toxic.</p>
    <h4> A Hierarchical Attention Model for Social Context Picture Suggestion (Using Machine Learning  )</h4>
    <p>"A Hierarchical Attention Model for Social Context Picture Suggestion" proposes an advanced machine learning approach to recommend images in social contexts by understanding both textual and visual information. The model utilizes a hierarchical attention mechanism to focus on the most relevant parts of the input data, such as important words in text descriptions and key features in images, effectively capturing the nuanced relationships between text, images, and social context. This hierarchical structure allows the model to integrate multi-level information, leading to more accurate and contextually appropriate picture suggestions. The approach addresses the complexity of aligning visual content with social cues, enhancing the relevance and personalization of image recommendations in social media and other platforms.</p>
